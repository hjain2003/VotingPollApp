# VotingPollApp
A voting poll app made using flutter and firebase

The votes can be cast by only those people who have a valid id and password which has been generated by the admin using the firebase console. Once a user casts his vote, he/she can no longer cast any other votes. Users can view the current status of the votes after they have cast theirs. This feature was added so as to make the voting process transparent. The result page gets updated automatically as the votes are cast.
